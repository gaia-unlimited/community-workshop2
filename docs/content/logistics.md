Everyone at the event will be open to diversity in the audience and any accessibility issues.

## <i class="fa-solid fa-bed"></i> Accommodation
Participants are responsible for making their own accommodation arrangements. Turino does not have large hotels near the meeting venue, but there are several hotels near Piazza Vittorio, which is about a 15 min walk from the Campus Luigi Einaudi where we have our workshop. In this area you can also find many restaurants, pubs and places of interest. The following hotels are some suggestions (but we don't endorse any particular hotel).
