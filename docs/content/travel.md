## Getting to Turin

### <i class="fa-solid fa-road"></i> Driving directions

The center of Torino is restricted access (ZTL; Zona traffico limitato). Check with your hotel to make sure that they have available parking, and whether you need a temporary permit to reach them.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-train"></i> Train

The two main train stations are Porta Nuova and Porta Susa. Assuming you are staying in a hotel near Piazza Vittorio, the most convenient public transport lines from Porta Susa are tram 13 or 13/ (dir Gran Madre), bus 55 (dir. Farini), or bus 56 (dir Tabacchi), while from Porta Nuova you will want to take bus 61 (dir San Mauro), but be aware that the bus stop for this line is not directly in front of the station, but on the east side of the station along Via Nizza. For the name of the bus/tram stop nearest your hotel, please check the hotel's website. Or you can easily get a taxi.
### <i class="fa-solid fa-plane"></i> Flight

if you arrive at the Torino airport, there are several ways to reach downtown Torino.
The cost of a taxi to the city center is about 30 euro and takes about 30 min, or you can take a [SADEM bus](http://www.aeroportoditorino.it/en/passeggeri_en/trasporti_en/bus_en.html) which makes stops near the two train stations mentioned above. The SADEM bus runs every 15min (between 7:00 and 19:30, last bus at 23:30), takes about 45/50min to reach the city center, and costs 6.50 euro if you buy the ticket inside the airport.
**There is a train station at the airport, but it is not convenient for reaching the city center.**

## Getting to the campus

If you are staying in a hotel in downtown Torino, then the best way to reach the meeting venue is by foot. For suggested directions from your hotel, check the link to the [Google map](), or confer with the hotel's reception.
