## Getting to Turin

### <i class="fa-solid fa-road"></i> Driving directions

The center of Torino is restricted access (ZTL; Zona traffico limitato). Check with your hotel to make sure that they have available parking, and whether you need a temporary permit to reach them.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-train"></i> Train

The two main train stations are Porta Nuova and Porta Susa. Assuming you are staying in a hotel near Piazza Vittorio, the most convenient public transport lines from Porta Susa are tram 13 or 13/ (dir Gran Madre), bus 55 (dir. Farini), or bus 56 (dir Tabacchi), while from Porta Nuova you will want to take bus 61 (dir San Mauro), but be aware that the bus stop for this line is not directly in front of the station, but on the east side of the station along Via Nizza. For the name of the bus/tram stop nearest your hotel, please check the hotel's website. Or you can easily get a taxi.

### <i class="fa-solid fa-plane"></i> Flight

Transportation from the airport to Torino can be done by taxi or bus. There are two bus services available, Arriva and Flibco. One way tickets are less than 10€, and it may be convenient to buy a two way ticket for your return to the airport.

The first, Arriva, has blue and green buses with "Torino Airport" written on the side, and they depart every fifteen minutes, with an additional express line that runs once an hour (last run at 15:10) and goes directly to the Porta Susa train station. Tickets can be purchased at the information booth in the arrivals area, or directly on the bus with credit card or bancomat.

The second, Flibco, has bright green buses, and runs once every 30 minutes. Tickets may be purchased online, via their Flibco app, at a dedicated Flibco desk in the arrivals area, or on the bus.

For further information on bus services to and from the airport see [this page](https://www.aeroportoditorino.it/it/tomove/trasporti-e-parcheggi/in-bus).

Taxi rides to the center of Torino cost about 40€

**There is a train station at the airport, but it is not convenient for reaching the city center.**

## Local public transport

If you arrive by train, or take the bus from the airport to bring you to Torino, you will arrive at the main train station, Porta Susa.  Google Maps should work fine for finding public transport to your hotel, or you can get a taxi from there.  For arriving at the venue, if walking is not an option, then bus number 12 stops in front of the meeting venue (stop "Politecnico").  You can buy bus tickets either at news kiosks or tabaccherie (tobacco shops indicated with a "T") or with a convenient app called "GTT - TO Move".

There are also bicycles and electric scooters scattered about that can be rented if you have data roaming on your phone.
